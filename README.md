# MapLibre Swift Macros

This package exists as a complement to the [MapLibre SwiftUI package](https://github.com/stadiamaps/maplibre-swiftui-dsl-playground).
It is temporarily necessary due to some quirks of Swift Packages, macros,
and the fact that MapLibre's [`master` branch currently lacks macOS support](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/issues/1609#issuecomment-1869685790).
